# Data-Visualization

I handled fundamental input operations, which included data validation and manipulation, ensuring accuracy and integrity throughout the process. Additionally, I implemented output operations to transform and present data in a clear and organized manner, making it easily interpretable for end users. This involved applying formatting techniques to enhance readability and effectively convey information.

I executed fundamental input operations in C++, which included data validation and manipulation, ensuring accuracy and integrity throughout the process. Additionally, I implemented output operations to transform and present data in a clear and organized manner, making it easily interpretable for end users. All of this was accomplished through the source code in the main.cpp file, where I applied formatting techniques to enhance readability and effectively convey information.
